This overview will cover my first draft of a wordpress blog in AWS. 

After the succesful deployment of this solution though, I was unhappy with the security, and also wanted to continue to explore infrastrucure as code with Terraform. 

Because of this - I decided to tear down this initial deployment and restart the blog of only 1 post into a better solution.

In my eagerness to get started, I may have forgot to grab some important information, but regardless, I wanted to document the architecture and steps I took to deploy this solutoin.
